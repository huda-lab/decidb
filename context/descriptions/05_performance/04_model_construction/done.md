# Model construction

Spans separate assembly/copies, implied bounds, objective/AVG assembly and indexing; then L0, ABS, not-equal, bilinear, MIN/MAX and construct lowering. Neutral-model phases cover bounds/types, linear/quadratic objectives, constraint expansion, global/general rows and sanity checks. Counters report variables, linear rows/nonzeros, quadratic rows/nonzeros and native constructs.

The old `model_construction_ms` ends before `SolverModel::Build`. The old `solver_ms` includes that neutral build, so those labels alone cannot identify backend time.
