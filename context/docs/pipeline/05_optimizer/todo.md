# Stage 05 — Optimizer: open work

Both items make the model smaller or the language wider without changing an answer that runs now.

## 1. A box per helper instance

**Why.** A helper keyed by a `by` key has one instance per group, but one column box: the
cover of every group's reach (`DeriveReducerValueBounds`, stage 06), because the column box
is per decision, not per instance. A small group's instance is boxed as wide as the
largest group's, which loosens the LP and the closing Big-M of a MIN/MAX helper, read off
that box.

**Ruling (owner, 2026-10-27).** Deferred until measured. Start it only when the helper-box measurement
(queue §11) shows a model where the shared box slows the solve. Where per-instance bounds live: `SolverInput` carries one
`lower_bounds` / `upper_bounds` entry per decision and stage 06 expands it across
`NumInstances`, so this needs a per-instance box in the stage 06/08 contract, or a box per
helper instance stated as rows.

**Test.** A dump of a helper over groups of different sizes shows each instance boxed by
its own group's reach and a smaller closing Big-M; the answer is unchanged on both
solvers.

## 2. `IN` under `per K:` once per class

**Why.** `RewriteInDomain` keeps the clause's `when` on the rows it emits but not its
`per K:`, so `per g: x IN (1, 2)` over a keyed `x` emits one indicator set per kept row
rather than per class: three rows in two classes give six indicators where four would
do. It is exact, because the key determines the decision and the domain.

**Decision needed.** None in the language. The indicators are row-scoped auxiliaries;
emitting them per class needs them keyed by `K` (a scope like a helper's) and the `per K:`
wrapper kept on the generated rows, as the MIN/MAX equality's easy half keeps it.

**Test.** The dump of `per g: x IN (1, 2)` over three rows in two classes shows four
indicators and four rows (a pick-one row and a linking row per class), not six and six;
DIAGNOSE still names the clause.
