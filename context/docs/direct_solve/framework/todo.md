# Shared engine — open work

The engine is everything that is not one problem class: IR, rule driver, plan fragments, runtime checks, bound reader,
result adapter, policy.
What exists today is in `done.md`. Direct solve declines each language construct it cannot yet model; the
solver path answers those queries, so none of them is wrong, only slower.

## How to work any task in these todo files

- Each task stands alone. Read its **Problem**, make the change and run the checks. When it ships, its result moves to
  the owning `done.md` and the task is deleted from its `todo.md`.
- The baseline to compare against is the stamp at the top of `done.md`. Any other failure after your change is yours.
- Checks that every code task runs (from the repository root): `make decide-test`,
  `DECIDB_TEST_DIRECT_SOLVE=off make decide-test`, `DECIDB_VERIFY_SERIALIZER=1 make decide-test`,
  `DECIDB_FORCE_SOLVER=highs make decide-test`,
  and `build/release/test/unittest "[decidb]"`. Rebuild first with `make release`. `test/decide/run_direct_matrix.sh` runs all
  five and prints one line each (about 3 minutes). Doc-only tasks need no checks.
- Do not loosen or delete a test to make it pass. If a test fails for a reason the task did not predict, stop and report it.
- Tasks marked **Decision needed** have two or more reasonable answers. Ask the owner before coding.
- The oracle tests cache solver results under the test's node id (`results/oracle_cache.json`). Do not rename a test
  function or move it to another file unless the task says so; a miss re-runs Gurobi, which needs a licence.
- The Bash tool is zsh. In `grep`, put `--include` flags before `-e PATTERN`; after a `--` they are read as file names.
- Stop and ask also when a golden changes that the task did not name, or a user-facing message needs wording the
  doc does not give. A task that turns out to need the owner records its question as **Decision needed**.
- A behavior change is judged by an oracle or the solver path, on both backends. A structural change gets a
  `decidb-architect` review.
- Never without the owner: large-tier benchmarks or other long CPU-bound runs, regenerating goldens before reading the
  diff, pushing, new branches or worktrees, `git stash`.

## H-47 — A square's constant past a DOUBLE answers where the solver raises

- **Problem.** `SELECT id, x FROM (SELECT 1 AS id, 1e200 AS v) DECIDE x(REAL) SUCH THAT x BETWEEN 0 AND 1e300
  MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - v, 2))` raises "computes a number too large for a DOUBLE" under `off` and answers 1e200
  under `require` (A1). A2's `per ():` form does the same. The solver expands `k*(w*x + t)^2` and its constant
  `k*t^2` overflows. `DirectLayoutQuadraticPart` lays out `w` and `t` and the rules fold only `a` and `b`, so no
  check reads the constant. Answering where the solver refuses is a wrong answer (`../architecture/rules.md` § What
  every rule must match from the solver).
- **Change.** Check the square's constant where the solver computes it, in the shared layout or fold, so that every
  rule using them raises the solver's text. Find where the solver raises (per term or on the summed constant) and match
  that point.
- **Done when.** The repro raises the same text under `require` and `off` for A1, A2 and N1's square objective, in
  `test_direct_user_facing.py`, and a constant just below the limit still answers on both paths.

## H-06 — The two-level objective `outer(per k: inner(e) by (k))`

- **Problem.** The objective is `MINIMIZE sum(per id: max(w*x) by (id))`. `ReadObjective`
  (`direct_ir.cpp`) declines on `IsTwoLevelObjectiveWrapper`. The nested-reducer reading (`DirectPart::inner` in
  `ReadReducer`) exists, but no query reaches it: the binder rejects a nested reducer anywhere else.
- **Change.** Read the two-level objective into the IR through the nested-reducer reading.
- **Done when.** `test_decidb_direct_ir.cpp`, "declines a two-level objective", reads the inner reducer. The nested order-0 norm case returns: an inner not-proved part leaves the outer not proved.
- **Needs (owner, 2026-10-29).** A rule that takes the shape. Read into the IR with no rule taking it, the reading was
  reached only by an IR test, so it was removed; this task waits for A2–A4 (`../todo.md`).

## H-08 — VALUE-shape clauses (helper decisions)

- **Decision needed.** The rule and clause shape this is for. No rule's definition takes a VALUE-shape clause, so
  reading the helper into the IR alone reaches no code.
- **Problem.** `ReadConstraint` (`direct_ir.cpp`) declines a leaf tagged `VALUE_REWRITE_TAG`. The solver builds a
  helper decision from `reducer_value_links`.
- **Options.** 1. Leave it until a rule names the shape it needs; the task then becomes that rule's. 2. The owner names
  a rule and shape now.
- **Recommendation.** 1.
- **Change.** Read the helper decision and its definition into the IR, so a rule that applies can take the clause.
- **Done when.** A differential case with a VALUE-shape clause runs on both paths with the same answer.
