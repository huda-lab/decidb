# Known bugs

## Limitations (not bugs)

- **A repair exactly at the tolerance on HiGHS's QP path.** An edit whose rows miss a summed bound by exactly the
  feasibility tolerance (1e-6) passes the certificate's LP on both backends, and Gurobi solves the edited query; HiGHS's
  QP path rejects it. HiGHS judges the same violation differently in its LP and QP paths.
- **Gurobi's barrier QP at stage 2.** On a 9,000-row QP repair Gurobi returns a point that breaks a row by 5.7e-5 and an
  objective value 24 above the optimum HiGHS finds (225000010024 against 225000010000). Inside Gurobi.
- **HiGHS on the edited 9,000-row QP.** It reaches its 300 s limit where Gurobi solves it.

Resolved behavior is documented by its owning `done.md`.
